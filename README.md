For this Demo we used the same phone number for both the seller and the buyer, this allows us to show the text messages that both users would receive on one phone.

## Summary

Sold Out was created in order for all its users to have a platform where they can place a product they own and would like to get rid of. We have been compared to other brands like LetGo and Ebay, but what makes us different and unique is the fact that we have live updates sent to all of our users (buyers & sellers). This form of constant updates along with our approach to letting the seller place a minimum bid amount for their product so they get profit to their liking has made Sold Out a huge hit within the re-sale market between consumers.

For this project we used Twilio API. Twilio is a Cloud Communications platform. That allows its users to send SMS,MMS, Emails, and Phone Calls to its clients. SoldOut uses Twilio’s SMS feature to notify the seller by sending a text message, when his or her product is posted, when a buyer bids on the product, and also when the auction is complete and a buyer has purchased the product they posted. The SMS feature also notifies the buyer after he bids on a product, and if he or she wins the product they bid on.
